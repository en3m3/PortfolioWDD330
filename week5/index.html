        <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
            <p>System Error- Issue with system or external devices the program is interacting with</p>
            <p>Programmer Error- Problem in the code. Logic or syntax issues</p>
            <p>User Error- User enters bad data that can't be handled by the program</p>
            <p>Stack trace displays the functions wrapping where the error took place</p>
            <p>Warnings are issues that aren't severe enough to break the program but most of the time should be corrected</p>
            <p>Strict mode is good because it keeps the code from using depricated/vunerable code and will error if there are normally non-breaking code, which avoids not seeing errors but having the results of them</p>
            <p>linting can be used as an addon to many editors/IDEs or sometimes can be run as a command line opperation. Linting allows code style and formatting to be checked against rules. Very useful in multi-coder projects</p>
            <p>Feature detection should be used to verify that dependancies are supported on the client's side before trying to load them., </p>
            <p>Try block of code -> Catch Exceptions -> Finally, run whatever code you need whether exception was thrown or not</p>
            <p>Test-driven Development. Start by writting the tests the program needs to pass then write the code to pass those tests</p>
            <p>Jest simplifies making Test-driven Dev not require so much extra work</p>
