        <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
            <p>System Error- Issue with system or external devices the program is interacting with</p>
            <p>Programmer Error- Problem in the code. Logic or syntax issues</p>
            <p>User Error- User enters bad data that can't be handled by the program</p>
            <p>Stack trace displays the functions wrapping where the error took place</p>
            <p>Warnings are issues that aren't severe enough to break the program but most of the time should be corrected</p>
            <p>Strict mode is good because it keeps the code from using depricated/vunerable code and will error if there are normally non-breaking code, which avoids not seeing errors but having the results of them</p>
            <p>linting can be used as an addon to many editors/IDEs or sometimes can be run as a command line opperation. Linting allows code style and formatting to be checked against rules. Very useful in multi-coder projects</p>
            <p>Feature detection should be used to verify that dependancies are supported on the client's side before trying to load them., </p>
            <p>Try block of code -> Catch Exceptions -> Finally, run whatever code you need whether exception was thrown or not</p>
            <p>Test-driven Development. Start by writting the tests the program needs to pass then write the code to pass those tests</p>
            <p>Jest simplifies making Test-driven Dev not require so much extra work</p>

            <li><em>What did I do since the last meeting?</em><br>
                I played around a lot with classes and prototypes. I was looking for the benefits of each and found prototypes to be 
                extremely powerful in Java. Most of the tinkering around was on the Todo project. My team had some issues this Week
                meeting together between schedules and me having a medical procedure in the middle of the week but we managed to message
                back and forth a decent amount. I did write the code entirely myself, since it was difficult without a shared git
                between us to coordinate it. I also played around with the idea of making a Hike object, but I tossed out the idea
                since the data was already an object, it seemed to not be worth the trouble to move it into a class object.
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em>
                I'm going to finish up the Todo activity this week. I'm hoping to work on the responsiveness of the html when adding
                and removing tasks. Maybe even have a small animation added to them to make it less of things just appearing and 
                disappearing as JavaScript tends to do if there isn't transitions of some kind.
            </li>
            <li><em>What are my blockers?</em><br>
                The team schedule has gotten a bit difficult. Someone recieved a calling that required them for the original time we 
                had chosen and we haven't really settled on another time yet.

                I haven't done much with modules. I understand their usefulness but I do need to look more into how to structure things 
                better when using them. I know on the hiking activity I could have done a better job. I'd like to do it better on the Todo
                assignment, so figuring that out will be important moving forward on that project.
