        <h1>Week 8 Notes </h1>
        <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 FOR THE REAL WORLD: 2ND EDITION Chapter 8- CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <p>The transform property is a really convenient way to add animation to your html elements</p>
        <p>Also supports 3d</p>
        <p>Older browsers prefer webkit or the ms kit to work, so it's nice to add for compatability</p>
        <p>Translate- moves the element on the x and y planes (sometimes can have strange behavior when the page loads. Sometimes you will see it jump to the new position once the css loads)</p>
        <p>Transforms don't work on inline elements (they do on inline-block however)</p>
        <p>Scale- increases/decrease size on x and/or y axis (looks really nice as a slight mouseover effect)</p>
        <p>transforms don't cause recalculation of space (it wont change any other elements)</p>
        <p>rotate- rotates on x or y (rotate3d can change z as well), skew- skews the element on x, y, or z</p>
        <p>transform-origin changes the point that the transformation changes relative to</p>
        <p>order of transforms matter</p>
        <p>The internet explorer is pretty terrible with rotate. It uses an old direct X image transform filter. It also has bad performance</p>
        <p>transition property adds animation between states (like active, hover, and focus) and sets settings for how to animate (speed, duration, motion curve, which elements to animate, and so on)</p>
        <p>for transition to work there must be a midpoint in the value of the property. Anything with a set number, like 30px -> 60px, colors calculate the midpoint color so they work as well.</p>
        <p>values like auto, visible/hidden, all the display property values, things like border style or font-family. Pretty much anything along those lines</p>
        <p>graceful degredation allows older browers to still display the final result of a transform just without the animation in between</p>
        <p>There are preset timing-functions that changes how much time to give different parts of the animation. Things like ease-in and ease-out, or the default linear. You can get even more specific and use a bezier curve or use steps</p>
        <p>steps are the most like frames</p>
        <p>translation-delay is exactly what it sounds like. Negative delays starts the animation at a different position but still begins right away</p>
        <p>to make an animation it requires 2 rules to be created, the animation and it's settings then the @keyframes that holds the actual animation</p>
        <p>animation fill mode tells the animation what to do when it finishes or starts(like reverse, infinite, forward)</p>
        <p>play-state can pause and unpause the animation</p>

        <h2>HTML5 & CSS3 FOR THE REAL WORLD: 2ND EDITION Chapter 12- Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
        <p>The innerHTML of canvas show if canvas isn't supported</p>
        <p>Set canvas height and weight inline. Since it is an HTML5 object CSS will only affect it's container.</p>
        <p>WebGl is the library used to draw in 3d. It's support is a little iffy still</p>
        <p>to draw you need to set the stroke and fill colors. There are also shapes that can be drawn with their own methods like strokeRect.</p>
        <p>top left is 0,0 bottom right is max x and y</p>
        <p>canvas uses CORS</p>
        <p>no accessibility with canvas</p>
        <p>SVGs are vectorbased XLM coded images. They preserve 100% of their quality when resized. They also tend to be smaller sized</p>
        <p>SVGs are available in the DOM, more limited if loaded through an image tag.</p>
        <p>canvas typically runs faster, since it doesn't have to write DOM elements to the DOM. It also has more ability to manipulate what is in it.</p>
        <p>drag and drop API. Only supported by the main desktop browsers.</p>
        <p>you can set elements to draggable="true"(draggable isn't a boolean. You have to add the =true)</p>
        <p>DataTransfer object contains the type of data and the data of the object being dragged</p>
        <p>drop and dragover are triggered by the dragged object</p>
        <h2>Team Exercise</h2>
            <a href="./team/index.html">Team Exercise</a>
        <hr>
        <h2>Weekly Standup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>What did I do since the last meeting?</em>
                Did the reading. I didn't do any of the exercises. I have used animations, transitions, and svgs a decent amount at work and previously. I have also done a bit at work with
                canvas, like creating particle effects like falling snow for example. The main thing I would like to jump into more with canvas would be memory management. I ran in to a few issues
                when there were too many particles moving.  I think it was good up until around 20,000, but even with reusing the particles by moving them when they go off the screen to the top it
                wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.
                Did a bunch of research into promises. I've used callbacks a good deal, and I have used async and await as well, but promises always seemed like they would end up
                as the mainstay for asynchronous functions so I wanted to get better at using them.  There were a few hiccups I ran into switching over from callbacks to promises in 
                the team excercise, I will go over those in the blocker question. 
                At work I have been been working on creating a decent Wiki for our custom Wordpress theme as well as being placed in charge of updating the theme and training the other
                developers for having accessibility be heavily supported. Our clients are mostly dentists and we have been getting calls asking whether we are ADA compliants. I'm 
                the sole developer for our theme now, so I've been researching the ADA guidelines a lot as well as finding solutions that would be maintainable for our 2000+ websites using
                our theme.  It has been a bit challenging, but I'm enjoying the ADA stuff because many of the newer web development features have been in the area of accessibility.
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em>
                 I think I'm going to continue to focus on programming with a component mentality, keeping the component code completely independant of the procedural part of the code. 
                 Specifically I will need to work on the problems I ran into this week relating to having the procedural code wait for the promise in the class's fetch to finish.
                 I also want to look into accessibility and canvas. I know it mentioned that because it is drawn into the element it doesn't meet accessibility guidelines, but I
                 want to research a bit to see if any solutions have been added, created, or proposed.
            </li>
            <li><em>What are my blockers?</em><br>
                On the team exercise  my team failed to meet again. Elizabeth has been the only one responding to messages so it has been a little frustrating the last few weeks. Natalia's new
                calling required her to be there when we had our previous time set, so ever since that it has been a problem. The block I ran into personally was my fetch was within a functions
                of my class so the object was created, then I called the fetch function, after that I went to use the response data to generate html, but in an attempt to allow more power to
                procedural code in main I had the class methods being called in main. The side effect was that the fetch didn't finish before the call to generate the HTML was called which gave
                me a nice undefined put in the container.  To fix it I changed the approach of my class to more of an interface mentality by limiting the amount of methods in the class that are 
                exposed to the user.  Making that change allowed me to call the function to generate the html from within the then() guaranteeing that the data would either have been received  or
                rejected prior to it's use.
