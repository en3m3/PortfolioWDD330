                <p>
                    Worked on my challenge assignment. Added some third party libraries to help with the program. I added a wrapper for the movie
                    database API to make it easier to work with, slick to make creating the carousels easier, and jQuery because it is a dependency
                    for slick. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em>
                <p>
                    Add a lot of styling to the challenge assignment as well as the rest of the portfolio to be closer to finishing it in a few weeks.

                    The comic api was having CORS issues. I added the domains I'm using to the allowed cross-server domains in my account for the API
                    but I believe I still have to add the cors headers to htaccess to get the comic API requests going through.

                    Life has been a bit hectic for me the last few weeks. My wife and I separated so I'm staying with my brother so it has been a bit
                    difficult to focus and getting used to the new setting.
