        <h1>Week 3 Notes - Novice to Ninja</h1>

        <h2>Object Methods article: this</h2>
        <p>This used in an object's method refers to the object</p>
        <p>Arrow functions do not have their own this so if used it will refer to the this of the outer normal function's this. Which is a useful trait of arrow functions that has many uses.</p>
        <p>If you set up a method that returns this in an object it will return the object, this does not work as a property.</p>
        <h2>Chapter 5 - Objects</h2>
        <p>Object literals wrap properties and methods</p>
        <p>Naming conventions camelcase thisObject and snake this_object</p>
        <p>Looping through an object in a for loop you can display all the properties and functions as well as their values</p>
        <p>Adding/changing/deleting new properties is the same as adding a new key-value pair. </p>
        <p>Objects can be nested in other objects</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6 - Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>ways to get DOM objects: getElementById , getElementsByClassName , getElementsByTagName , querySelector and querySelectorAll</p>
        <p>query selector is good for very specific targeting. Returns a non-live node/nodelist </p>
        <p>queryselector() returns first occurence only, queryselectorall() returns all matching DOM elements</p>
        <p>childrenNodes returns all children nodes, including text nodes of the element children only returns the children elements ignoring text nodes</p>
        <p>firstChild on a node list returns first child node lastChild returns last</p>
        <p>parentNode property returns the parent</p>
        <p>nextSibling and previousSibling returns the adjacent nodes either before or after</p>
        <p>nodeValue returns the text if used on a text node</p>
        <p>className with replace all classes on a node classList you can add and remove specific classes</p>
        <p>createElement creates a new node of the type you sent as a parameter</p>
        <p>appendChild adds the node as a child of the element</p>
        <p>textContent doesn't allow html, innerHTML does. if you aren't using html textContent is less resource intensive</p>
        <p>getElementBy* methods return a live node which means if changed it will change the element in the DOM. </p>
        <p>style property changes css</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7 - Events</h2>
        <p>inline event handlers are attributes in html tags such as onclick</p>
        <p>inline breaks the concept of keeping html and js separate</p>
        <p>addEventListener is prefered way now</p>
        <p>event parameter is automatically sent from a event listener which contains information about the event, such as scrollbar offset after an onscroll event is triggered</p>
        <p>mouse and touch events need to both be considered with current technology</p>
        <p>if you will be removing an eventListener to not use an anonymous function when you add it, you will need to reference the function to remove it. </p>
        <p>Event handling, capturing/bubbling/delegation</p>
        <p>Capturing is useful when you have outside code you want to run before handling the event</p>
        <p>Bubbling resolves from the element triggering the event up to the parents</p>
        <p>Capturing propagate downwards from the parents to the children</p>
        <p>You can use bubbling and capturing together if you add more listeners</p>
        <p>Using stopPropagation() can prevent events from triggering much higher up in the bubbling to not fire which can cause problems if you aren't careful.</p>
