        <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
        <h2>Mastser Mobile UX</h2>
        <p>Mobile first mentality. Need to rewire your brain to not think of desktop content and sizes first. Mobile first forces a content first design to make sure content will be visible on all devices</p>
        <p>Focus groups unreliable. Watch what they do not what they say. Top area of phones and tablets are hard to reach.</p>
        <p>Better results when main controls are at the bottom easy to reach areas. Software typically isn't made well, we just settle for it. It's up to design and programming to rise above it.</p>
        <p>Engineer/design stardards aren't always known to consumers. Icons like the hamburger menu aren't always understood</p>
        <p>Mobile constraints force simplification</p>
        <p>Reduce cognitive load. Remove unnecessary things, especially input fields in mobile.</p>
        <p>Increase the size of buttons and fields in mobile to make touch input easier</p>
        <p>Use the right keyboard type(numberpad for credit cards and currency. Datepicker for dates)</p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Trailing/terminal commas are nice when you will be adding to a list</p>
        <p>Anonymous functions are nice to run just after DOM loads.</p>
        <h2>Doing stuff with web things</h2>
        <p>In progress still. Much of it is similar to project I have worked on recently, like a calculator for a dental practice to show what things would cost with the credit company they partnered with</p>
        <p>A little unrelated but I was working on a bug with closed captioning on firefox at work and ended up digging into CORS, I would like to get back to it more. I think that was the issue causing my bug, I'll find out Monday. I would like to understand how to work with the CORS settings and also CSP to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the client side.</p>
