        <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
        <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
        <p>Mobile first mentality. Need to rewire your brain to not think of desktop content and sizes first. Mobile first forces a content first design to make sure content will be visible on all devices</p>
        <p>Focus groups unreliable. Watch what they do not what they say. Top area of phones and tablets are hard to reach.</p>
        <p>Better results when main controls are at the bottom easy to reach areas. Software typically isn't made well, we just settle for it. It's up to design and programming to rise above it.</p>
        <p>Engineer/design stardards aren't always known to consumers. Icons like the hamburger menu aren't always understood</p>
        <p>Mobile constraints force simplification</p>
        <p>Reduce cognitive load. Remove unnecessary things, especially input fields in mobile.</p>
        <p>Increase the size of buttons and fields in mobile to make touch input easier</p>
        <p>Use the right keyboard type(numberpad for credit cards and currency. Datepicker for dates)</p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Trailing/terminal commas are nice when you will be adding to a list</p>
        <p>Anonymous functions are nice to run just after DOM loads.</p>
        <h2>Doing stuff with web things</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The review sections are things I use regularly at work so no questions on them.</p>
        <p>I've used local storage a bit already as well and the key value pairs fair more.</p>
        <p>A little unrelated but I was working on a bug with closed captioning on firefox at work and ended up digging into CORS, I would like to get back to it more. I think that was the issue causing my bug, I'll find out Monday. I would like to understand how to work with the CORS settings and also CSP to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the client side.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Standup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>What did I do since the last meeting?</em><br>
            -Set up the portfolio on GitHub<br>
            -Did the reading including the UX design 
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em><br>
            - Next I would like to adjust my work patterns to match the modified scrum I’m used to so that I am aware on a daily basis what I’ve been doing and what I should be working on next. I would also like to have a better overall understanding of where I want things to be at the end so that knowing what I need to focus on becomes clearer.
            </li>
            <li><em>What are my blockers?</em><br>
            - This week the blockers were external issues. I’ve been getting over being sick for a few weeks and in that time I got a new laptop for school and had trouble feeling well enough to have it ready in the way I hoped before school started. <br>
            - The installation and setups all were relatively smooth, but I have more work to do with extensions and other things to get the environment closer to what I would like to be working in.</li>
