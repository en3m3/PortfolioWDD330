            <li><em>What did I do since the last meeting?</em><br>
                Worked on my Todo assignment a lot. Reserched a bit more into local storage for it, it's relatively easy as long as 
                key value pairs are understood well enough. I also tried a lot harder to keep the project more of a module because it seemed like
                the idea behind it might make sense to be reused.
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em>
                Next week we are going to study a bit of AJAX, which I'm excited about. It's another area that I've worked with, but always wished I knew more.
            </li>
            <li><em>What are my blockers?</em><br>
                Just a few errors that I am having a hard time understanding the cause of. For example, in my class methods I have
                two methods declared the same way. name = function() {}; using the anonymous function notation. It works on all of them
                except one. For some reason it is giving me an error that it is not a function. It may have to do with the instance of another
                class being created in the first line of the method.
