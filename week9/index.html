        <h1>Week 8 Notes </h1>
        <h2>Novice to Ninja: Chapter 9 The Window Object</h2>
        <p>window is a global object that represents the browser window which contains the web page(web document)</p>
        <p>Browser Object Window(BOM) good acronym. Seems familiar. Holds properties and methods for the browser and screen</p>
        <p>BOM only significant in a browser windows. Other environments wont have the global.</p>
        <p>there are many methods of windows that we have used without recognizing they were methods. (parseInt, isNaN, alert, confirm, prompt)</p>
        <p>browser information is congainer in the Navigator object. navigator.userAgent returns browser and operating system being used </p>
        <p>window.location returns the current url. location.href changes the url to a new one(redirects page) location.protocol returns the protocol
            (http:, https:,ftp:, and so on. location.hostname returns domain. location.port returns the port number(sometimes empty)
            location.pathname returns everything after the domain. location.search returns the url parameter string</p>
        <p>window.location.hash returns any string following a # in the url. location.origin returns protocol and domain that the page originated from</p>
        <p>window.location.reload() reloads the page. reload(true) forces uncached reload. location.assign() loads another resource from another location
            location.replace() does the same without keeping session data. location.toString() returns url as a string
        </p>
        <p>window.history. history.go(int) goes forward or backwards the amount that is passed to it. history.forward and history.back goes forward or backwards one</p>
        <p>window.open() opens a new window. parameters open(url, window title, attributes)</p>
        <p>window.close() lets you close a window, like a popup</p>
        <p>window.moveTo() moves the window to the coordinates given</p>
        <p>window.resizeTo() resizes to the width and height passed to it. </p>
        <p>window.screen holds screen information. screen.height, screen.width, screen.availWidth, screen.availHeight, screen.colorDepth</p>
        <p>window.document.  The document property contains the items on the page. document.write() writed to the document replacing anything that was previously contained</p>
        <p>cookies sore key value pairs separated by semicolons. Persist past page reloading</p>
        <p>create using document.cookie = 'key=value'; new additions are appended, doesnt override values unless the key is the same</p>
        <p>to read cookies use split with ; as the delimiter</p>
        <p>setting an expires value or max-aged allows the cookies to exist past the session</p>
        <p>browsers handle expiration differently so you shouldn't rely on it for functionality.</p>
        <p>secure cookies force https</p>
        <p>to delete cookies set the expiration to a time in the past. Session cookies are erased when the window is closed</p>
        <p>setTimeout runs a function after a certain delay, setInterval runs a function repeatedly after a set delay. clearInterval stops the timer/ends the interval/timeout</p>
        <p>window.requestAnimationFrame() similar to setInterval except it uses the browsers animation capabilities. cancelAnimationFrame ends it</p>
        <p>Most of the time CSS animations are better to use</p>

        <h2>Novice to Ninja: Chapter 14 HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <p>data attributes. begin with data-. May have a balue, but it can also be bool</p>
        <p>data attributes are stored in an element's dataset property. When referencing then in the property the hyphens and removed and the name is converted to camel-case</p>
        <p>getAttribute() can also get dataset values</p>
        <p>web storage. The window object has a localStorage and sessionStorage property. Both are stored as key value pairs.</p>
        <p>getItem and setItem can be used with the storages, as well as dot notation</p>
        <p>delete and removeItem can remove an entry. clear() removes all entries.</p>
        <p>when a value is saved to one of the storages it triggers a storage event. The properties the callback has are key, newValue, oldValue, and storageArea</p>
        <p>Geolocation API is used to obtin the devices location. navigator.geolocation.getCurrentLocation() returns a position object that has a coords property that holds latitude and longitude among other things</p>
        <p>watchPosition() calls a callback any time the location changes. clearWatch() removes it</p>
        <p>Web Workers allow processes to run in the background. You use Worker() to create one.</p>
        <p>stop wowrker with terminate() or close()</p>
        <p>websockets allow two way communication. Push messaging.</p>
        <p>Notification API. Need permission before using. requestPermission() method to get permission.</p>
        <p>media api. Audio and video tags</p>
        <p>canvas api</p>
        <p>shim and polyfill help allow use of the newest API abilities without breaking the site for people with browsers that do not support them.</p>
