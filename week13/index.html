                <p>
                    Most of my week was spend figuring out why the domains being added to the allow list in the comic api settings
                    werent working. I did finally figure out what was happening. Which made me feel a lot less worried about getting
                    it finished in time                </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em>
                <p>
                    There are two things left: figuring out how to use the name from the movie to search for the name in the comic database.
                    Some of the names are formatted differently so I will have to figure out some kind of algorithm that will check the full name,
                    then maybe the start, middle, and end separately then have some kind of user selection between them in case more than one shows up
                    in the search. The second is styling. It will probably end up just being as styled as whatever time I have after finishing the search
                    function.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>What are my blockers?</em><br>
                <p>
                    Just figuring out a good algorithm for the search. It shouldn't be that hard. I just want to make sure I am careful not to
                    have to rescan the data from the comic api, which will mean checking against multiple strings the first time through. Another option is figureing
                    which page of results the character is on first since I believe the search returns them in alphabetic order. I may be able to use 
                    a binary tree search to make the search's big-O notation better.
                    </output>
