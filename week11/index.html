                <p>I had a pretty rough week outside of school and work. One of the side effects of the things going on was that I had to
                    reinstall all the software for my school classes on another computer, which took a while. Things are settling down and
                    I'm still working through some personal things, but the situation I'm in is much more stable than it was last week.
