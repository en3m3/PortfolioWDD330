        <h1>Week 7 Notes </h1>
        <h2>Novice to Ninja Chapter 11 - Further Functions</h2>
        <p>function's length property returns the number of parameters recieves</p>
        <p>call is used to cinvoke a function</p>
        <p>apply is similar but it sends the parameters as an array. Spred in ES6 makes it uncessesary</p>
        <p>omemoization is the caching of function results. Really nice to prevent repeating resource heavy functions</p>
        <p>you can add properties to functions(yeah for everything having a prototype object</p>
        <p>IIFE functions are a good way to run functional code while maintaining a separate scope for the variables and objects. Clean up after yourself. Also for initialization</p>
        <p>Throw your use strict into a IIFE function to prevent it from breaking 3rd party code</p>
        <p>functions can rewrite themselves. Pretty cool, you can have an initial check then determine which should be used the rest of the runtime</p>
        <p>properties are lost if a function is redefined.</p>
        <p>init time branching good for changing code based on support of certain features</p>
        <p>Recursive functions, bleh, really useful in certain circumstances</p>
        <p>callbacks...callbacks are a function sent as a parameter that gets called when the function is done. Helps forces a run order without making the program wait</p>
        <p>callbacks can get messy if used heavily</p>
        <p>promises can help simplify callback abuse</p>
        <p>promise->pending->resolved or rejected</p>
        <p>results from resolved and rejected go to then(). resolved is the first parameter, rejected is the second.</p>
        <p>catch can also be used to handle errors.</p>
        <p>promise chain. makes promises easy to read</p>
        <p>async functions are similar to promises but they use await</p>
        <p>closure is when the inner function is returned by the outer function allowing access to everything in it</p>
        <p>the variable that is assigned to the outer function can now access both </p>
        <p>generator functions- don't run the code inside of them, they create an iterator that adds the next method which runs the code</p>
        <p>also adds yield that is similar to return but the value of yield is remembered after for the next() call</p>
        <p>pure function- depends on only values provided to it(no outside values), doesn't change any values outside of the function, same variables = same results</p>

        <h2>Novice to Ninja Chapter 13 - Ajax</h2>
        <p>resource requesting from a server</p>
        <p>CORS - controls which domains can recieve data from the server. Not always super consistant across browsers</p>
        <p>ajax allows for new data to be requested and accessed without having to reload the page(server actions are only done before it gets to the client side)</p>
        <p>Fetch APO standardized a newer/"better" version of XMLHttpRequest object</p>
        <p>response object, headers, url, redirected bool, type</p>
        <p>blob object is raw data, returned when a file is requested. </p>
        <p>headers pass additional information. set and append can add additional items</p>
        <p>fetch API has the FormData interface which makes it easier to submit form information via Ajax</p>
        <p>results of from the form submission ends up in body</p>
        <p>you can append key calue pairs to a formdata object</p>
        <p>fetch API is being developed still so it is subject to change. The jQuery ajax() function is a good more stable alternative</p>
        <p>$.ajax(url).done(output)</p>

            <li><em>What did I do since the last meeting?</em><br>
                I practiced using the different types of functions that were in the reading. I wanted to play around with 
                the way IIFE functions work and why they are useful, since I do see them fairly often. I also did a little
                bit of practice with callbacks again. It was easier to understand the usefulness after reading the part about
                async functions and promises. In the end I feel like promises may be the best direction to go typically but 
                callbacks still seem pretty nice when there are a few different functions that may need to be run after the same
                function is finished.
            </li>
            <li><em>What am I going to do next?</em>
                One thing I don't have much practice with it using cache. The forms we made at work use them and I was having a
                hand time with it because when there were issues with the submission I kept running into the fields being cached
                and I didn't really know how to maneuver around cache. I would like to spend some time seeing the ins and outs of
                cache since I use it at work and the ability to 'save' results that a function returns seems pretty nice.

            </li>
            <li><em>What are my blockers?</em><br>
                I ran into the issue on the team assignment that after looking at the teacher's solution I don't really know how
                to use MVC without having php involved. I'm mainly concerned with the controller. I understand MVC for the most part
                but I think shifting from a php controller JavaScript is a bit more difficult when it comes to timing of different 
                functions and DOM elements existing. With php it seems a bit more concise because it all runs when the page is loading.
                I played around with the teacher's solution a bit to see how to avoid the errors I kept getting, but there are still a
                few I run into frequently that tend to be related to the DOM object being null.

                My team also had problems solidifying a time so we ended up pretty much on our own.
